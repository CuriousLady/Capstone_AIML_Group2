# Capstone_AIML_Group2


This is a capstone project titled Generative AI carried out as part of the advanced certification in AIML program organized by talentsprint in association with International Institute of Information technology, Hyderabad. This program consists of two tasks. 1. Email Subject line generation and 2. Question Answer generation.

Task 1: **Email Subject Generation**

Problem Statement

As opposed to commonly solved tasks in the domain of news summarization or headline generation – which are closely related works to this problem. This task offers uniqueness in having to generate extremely short, concise summary in the form of the email subject.
Sub tasks
·  	Identify the most salient sentences from the email body,
·  	Abstract the message contained in those sentences into only a few words.
·  	Play with generative models in NLP, using any GPT2 variant of choice.
·  	Evaluate text generation through different metrics


TASK 2: **Question Answer Generation**

Problem Statement

Having learnt the process of model finetuning and evaluation on the first task, the second task primarily revolves around fulfilling the objective of the second task:
modeling a domain-specific GPT-variant model that can answer questions specific to the AIML course.
Sub tasks
•   	It has been observed that while pretrained models can produce relevant textual output for general, open-domain textual prompts, the models lack the capability of producing finer outputs when it comes to domain-specific tasks.
•   	Finetune the model on a dataset specific to this task, to tailor its experience
•   	Build a novel, relevant dataset for the task. Post finetuning
•   	Observe its performance on unseen, related questions.
